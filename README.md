# Real-Life-Deep-Learning-Model-Implementations-in-Python-and-R
This massive code base will help developers interested in Machine Learning and Deep Learning gain a more practical
hands-on development experience in AI.
Most of the models have been implemented in both Python and R.
This covers both supervised and unsupervised learning. I have shared the datasets as well.
Keras, Tensorflow, Pytorch, and various other industry-standard deep learning packages have been used.
Almost 30 models have been include which include:
1. Simple Linear Regression
2. Multiple Linear Regression
3. Polynomial Regression
4. Support Vector Regression (SVR)
5. Decision Tree Regression & Decision Tree Classification
6. Random Forest Regression & RF Classification
7. Logistic Regression
8. K-Nearest-Neighbors (KNN)
9. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
10. Kernel SVM
11. Naive Bayes
12. K-Means Clustering
13. Hierarchical clustering (Dendrograms)
14. Associate Rule Learning -> Apriori, Eclat
15. Reinforcement Learning UCB (solving the multi-arm bandit problem)
16. Reinforcement Learning Thompson Sampling
17. NLP (Removing stop words, stemming, Bag of Words model)
18. Deep Learning (ANN)
19. DL (CNN)
20. DL (RNN)
21. DL (Boltzmann Machines)
22. DL (Autoencoder) 
23. PCA, Kernel PCA
24. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
25. K-Fold-Cross_Validation
26. Grid_Search
27. XGBoost
